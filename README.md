RAWG is born out of a student project at Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to provide an easy and intuitive way for researchers to conduct RNA-Seq analysis and compare different analysis pipelines, by automatically generate workflows based on user-selected tools.

For an online demo of the front-end interface, please see [user guide](/doc/userguide.md) and [demo](http://rawg.tony.tc).

For a detailed write-up, please see [report](https://github.com/rawgene/rawg/blob/master/doc/RNASeq_report_CC.pdf)

Note: RAWG was previously hosted in a single repo under a personal account (with 700+ commits). The project was reorganised and transferred to this organisational account to better decouple different components of RAWG. The origanal project, which is under archival now, can be seen [here](https://github.com/tonyyzy/RNASeq/)
